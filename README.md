This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Challenge 1: Incorporate a “Follow” Button
### Task: Add a button to the ProfileCard. This button should initially display “Follow.” When users click it, the label should change to “Following.”
## Challenge 2: Insert a Likes Counter
### Task: Integrate a likes counter into the ProfileCard. Users should be able to click a “Like” button and observe an increment in the number of likes.
# Stretch Goal:
### Design an additional component titled Interests that showcases a list of the user’s hobbies or interests. Integrate this new component into the ProfileCard to display the user’s hobbies right under their bio.
